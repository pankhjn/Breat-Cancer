# Overview of Data
Cancer Data Set has 8 different features which are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: 
Radius
compactness (perimeter 2 / area - 1.0)
Texture
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
Perimeter
Concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
Area
Symmetry
Smoothness
Fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" 
Data set is composed of the mean, standard error and the “worst” of the above attributes
Data set contains patient ID number, and Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
